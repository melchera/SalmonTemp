#' air_conduction
#'
#' This model computes the temperature increase of a body of water through conduction with the air.
#' @param Q  streamflow in cubic feet per second (cfs)
#' @param A surface area of water interacting with the air (square feet)
#' @param wtemp water temperature in degrees Celcius
#' @param atemp air temperature in degrees Celcius
#' @param res_time residence time of water in hours over which it is interacting with the air
#' @return the function returns the temperature (degrees C) of the water body after a given residence time 
#' @example air_conduction()
