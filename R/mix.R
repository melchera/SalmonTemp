#' mix
#'
#' This model computes the output streamflow and temperature from two different rivers mixing, each with their own streamflow and temperature. 
#' @param Q  streamflow in cubic feet per second (cfs)
#' @param temp water temperature in degrees Celcius
#' @return the function returns the streamflow (cfs) and temperature (degrees C) of the combined rivers 
#' @example mix()
